# Malware-Guard
Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software specifically designed to harm or exploit computer systems, steal data, disrupt operations, or gain unauthorized access. It poses a significant threat to cybersecurity.

Input Layer: Receives raw input data, such as images.
Convolutional Layers: Three sets of convolutional layers with increasing filters (32, 64, 128). 
Max Pooling Layers: After each convolutional layer, max-pooling layers with a pool size of (2, 2) . 3.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D output to a 1D array. 
Dense Layers: Two dense layers with ReLU activation (128 units) and a final softmax layer for classification. 


RESNET50 Model:

Input Layer: Accepts input images of fixed size (usually 224x224 pixels).
Convolutional Layers: The network begins with a single convolutional layer followed by a max pooling layer for downsampling.
Residual Blocks: ResNet50 consists of multiple residual blocks. Each block contains several convolutional layers, with skip connections (or shortcuts) that add the original input to the output of the block. These connections help propagate gradients during training and make it easier to train very deep networks.
Global Average Pooling: At the end of the convolutional layers, a global average pooling layer is applied to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps to a vector.
Fully Connected Layers: Following the global average pooling layer, there are fully connected layers that serve as the high-level reasoning part of the network.
Output Layer: The final layer is typically a softmax layer that produces the probabilities of each class for classification tasks.
